# Travelling Flame (IPT 2025)

**September - October, 2024**

- Contributed to an International Physicist’s Tournament (IPT) problem by analysing flame propagation in a fuel tube.
- Developed a computer vision script in Python to track and quantify flame movement from high-speed experimental video.
- Extracted and processed key data (e.g., flame velocity, position) to help the team validate its theoretical model.
