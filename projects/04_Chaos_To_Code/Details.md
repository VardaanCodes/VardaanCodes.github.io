# Chaos To Code

**July 2025 - Present**

- Developing a first-principles simulation library for core mechanical engineering phenomena using Python (Numpy, Sympy, Scipy).
- Developed symbolic models for cam profile generation (e.g., 3-4-5 polynomial, cycloidal) using SymPy to analytically derive and visualise their kinematic properties (jerk, acceleration).
- Developing a 2D convection-diffusion solver by numerically discretising Reynolds’ Transport Theorem.
