# GoTo Tracker and Dobsonian Mount

**November - December 2025**

- Designing and fabricating a custom Dobsonian mount and GoTo tracking system from scratch using CAD software, and using FEA for structural validation.
- Applying kinematic principles and spherical trigonometry to model celestial motion and required mount dynamics.
- Developing embedded firmware for the alt-azimuth (AZ) mount to perform real-time coordinate transformations and enable automated object tracking.
